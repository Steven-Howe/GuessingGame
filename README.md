                        ---Game Instructions---

        The Guessing Game has three levels; Easy, Medium, and Hard.
        
        The goal of the game is to guess the correct number before
        your lives run out. Each successive level grants more points
        for correct answers than the previous. Your points are stored
        in the score bank and can be accessed via the options menu.
        
         If you guess the correct number without running out of lives
        then you win the game! And if you happen to guess the correct 
        number within the first two tries you will gain extra points. 
        However, if you run out of lives you will loose the game with 
        the option to try again.
